# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The SiteSurveyor project is currently in the pre-development phase, and no official versions have been released yet. Once we release a stable version (expected to be version `1.0.0`), we will list supported versions here and provide ongoing security updates for those versions.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| None    | :x:                |


Only the latest minor versions of each major release receive active security updates. If youâ€™re using an older version, please consider upgrading to a supported release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in SiteSurveyor, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible. 

### How to Report

Please send a detailed report to our security team at [admin@eineva.co.zw](mailto:admin@eineva.co.zw). Include as much information as possible, such as:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any potential security impact or risks

### Response Time and Updates

Once we receive your report, you can expect an initial response within 72 hours. The security team will investigate and respond with any required steps or requests for additional information. Updates on the status of the issue will be provided periodically until the vulnerability is resolved.

### What to Expect

- **Accepted Vulnerabilities**: If the vulnerability is valid and affects a supported version, our team will work to resolve it promptly. We may release a security patch and credit you in the release notes, if desired.
- **Declined Vulnerabilities**: If the vulnerability is not accepted (e.g., does not pose a significant risk), we will provide a clear explanation.

Thank you for helping us keep SiteSurveyor secure for all users.
